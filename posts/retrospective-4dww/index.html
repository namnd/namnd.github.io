InDebted, <a href="https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/workplace/why-indebted-is-australia-s-best-place-to-work-20220407-p5aboy#:~:text=Introducing%20a%20four-day%20week,BOSS%20Best%20Place%20to%20Work">who won the best place to work in Australia in 2022</a> is one of the first companies in Australia that offers four days working week as well as fully remote work.
As I have been working 4DWW for almost a year now, I want to reflect on this experience, mostly for my personal development, but also might be useful to someone else.</p><h2 id=the-good-ones>The good ones</h2><p>When I first started the job, it felt surreal. I never thought about it. I wasn&rsquo;t looking for that criteria at all. In fact, when the recruiter approached me, 4DWW wasn&rsquo;t even mentioned, until very last round of interview. So, when I got the job, I was like, that sounds really cool, imagine free time I will have, maybe I can work on a side hustle project or something.</p><h4 id=work-life-balance>Work-life balance</h4><p>Without a doubt, I would say the most benefit of 4DWW is a great work-life balance.</p><p>Before that, I was always trying to have a decent work-life balance.
Working from home kinda helped a lot.
However, 4DWW does makes a big difference. Surprisingly, an extra day off is actually a whole lot of time. It&rsquo;s so much easier to organise outside of work appointments. I can have more quality time not just with family, and friends, but also for myself. I exercise more often. I just feel much better, physically and mentally.</p><h4 id=am-i-more-productive-at-work>Am I more productive at work?</h4><p>In a short version, I would say YES. However, it&rsquo;s not that simple to tell at first.</p><p>In short terms, am I more happy at work? Probably yes? Do I get more stuff done? Unlikely. It would be lying if I said I can get as much work done as I would work 5 days a week.</p><p>However, when thinking about a span of 1 year period, it could be a different story.</p><ul><li><p>For the whole one year at InDebted, apart from the New Year holiday, I only took 1 annual leave (family business), and 1 personal (carer) leave. I never have that feeling of burnout like some of my previous roles. I don&rsquo;t feel like I need more rests. I have more than enough every week. I am just excited to be back on every single Monday. In contrast to my previous roles, I often used almost all the leaves I have to take rest in between busy weeks.</p></li><li><p>All the works that I have done during this one year, there was <strong>zero</strong> bug, or any reworks required. This could be partially due to our engineering culture. But I would also argue that the fresh mind also help me to produce quality work overall.</p></li></ul><h2 id=hows-about-the-bad-ones>How&rsquo;s about the bad ones?</h2><p>To be honest, I can&rsquo;t really think of any bad thing about 4DWW. Like, if you ask any employees, who would ever complain about it, right? ðŸ˜›</p><p>Although, one thing might potentially have a negative impact on my career would be working less meaning I might be progressing a bit slower than others who work their asses off.
Especially in techs where things evolve super fast, moving slow is just as bad as not moving.</p><h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s next?</h2><p>4DWW is definitely a nice perk to have. However, it&rsquo;s not such a big deal breaker for me, at least not as much as remote working.
The main reason is that I have been enjoying doing what I am doing very much. &ldquo;If you do what you love, you&rsquo;ll never work a day in your life&rdquo; as said by many.
I wouldn&rsquo;t mind working 5 days at all, as long as I can work from anywhere, and hours can be flexible enough to accommodate decent work-life balance.</p><p>In fact, very often, I do work overtime, either late night, or in the weekends, whenever I have some free time for myself.
I just enjoy working on the problems that still stuck in my head, doesn&rsquo;t matter it&rsquo;s my daytime job or personal projects.</p></div><div class=post-tags></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>Â© Copyright namnd.com | <a href=https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil>Ezhil theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
