In the &lt;a href="/posts/my-workstation-setup/">first part&lt;/a>, I talked about GnuPG and Yubikey. In this post, I will share my OS (Operating System) level setup.
This setup is heavily inspired by &lt;a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/nixos-config">Michell Hashimoto&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My workstation setup</title><link>/posts/my-workstation-setup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 10:02:33 +1100</pubDate><guid>/posts/my-workstation-setup/</guid><description>&lt;p>I believe WFH is going to be (if not already) a new normal for the tech industry.
The benefits of it undeniably outweigh some of its disadvantages.
However, in my opinion, there is one major problem with WFH, that is security compliance.
There are enough stories, or articles about this, so I am not going to explain why that is the case.
Instead, I want to share my own setup, as an effort to have a reasonably secure and compliance workstation at home.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A retrospective of 4DWW</title><link>/posts/retrospective-4dww/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 23:01:04 +1100</pubDate><guid>/posts/retrospective-4dww/</guid><description>&lt;p>In exactly two weeks, it will be my one year anniversary at InDebted.
InDebted, &lt;a href="https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/workplace/why-indebted-is-australia-s-best-place-to-work-20220407-p5aboy#:~:text=Introducing%20a%20four-day%20week,BOSS%20Best%20Place%20to%20Work">who won the best place to work in Australia in 2022&lt;/a> is one of the first companies in Australia that offers four days working week as well as fully remote work.
As I have been working 4DWW for almost a year now, I want to reflect on this experience, mostly for my personal development, and hopefully, it might also be useful to someone else.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
