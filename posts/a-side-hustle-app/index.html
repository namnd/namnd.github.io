&#183; 3 min read</div></div><div class=markdown><p>For the last 4 months, I have been working on a side hustle mobile app. For a long time, I&rsquo;ve been wanted to build something. This is not the first one I started something, but sadly (or luckily) this is the first one I actually make it to public, and I am pretty happy about it. This blog post is dedicated for this side hustle project, a mini mobile app, called <strong>itemeter</strong>.</p><h2 id=how-it-started>How it started</h2><p>The idea is nothing special. It&rsquo;s really simple, maybe too simple that no ones care to make such an app.
It actually came out of a problem that my wife and I had recently. We usually went shopping together in the past, but recently, when we had our second child, it&rsquo;s more often that we have to split the household duties. In particularly, I would go shopping while my wife is feeding the baby, or cooking meal, and so on.</p><p><em>&ldquo;Any household have a list of items to buy. Sooner or later, you will run out of some, and need to go to the supermarket to restock. It&rsquo;s not unusual (or at least happened to me a dozen of times) is that you just got home from a trip to shopping mall, just to realise something else is running out soon. It&rsquo;s super annoying. Our brain is busy with many other things in life, and we just often forgot a little small thing. Stuffs just don&rsquo;t run out at the same time. But hey, if we know how much left, we can be well prepared and almost never running out of things.&rdquo;</em></p><p>This <a href=https://itemeter.com>itemeter</a> app is just another tiny productivity app that hopes to help you achive such small things, but sometime can make a big difference.</p><p><img src=/website.png alt></p><h2 id=but-why>But why</h2><p>There are probably many similar apps out there that can be used for this purpose. A simple Todo app will do 70% of the job. The Notes app by Apple almost got you cover too. So, why another one. Well, for a couple of reasons:</p><ul><li>I couldn&rsquo;t find exact app that fulfill my requirements. Sometime, family cannot go shopping together. I don&rsquo;t know some of stuff my wife need, and vice versa. By sharing the list for all members of the family, it makes things much easier.</li><li>My wife and I will definitely be using this app. We find it really useful, so why not share it with many other families for (hopefully) a small revenue from it.</li><li>It&rsquo;s a side hustle thing. I am not an indie hacker nor a startup guy, but the idea is so simple to start with, so I guess I can just spend a couple of weeks to build it. Of course, it took much longer than that, but I had a great time hacking to ship this thing.</li></ul><h2 id=tech-stacks>Tech stacks</h2><p>I built mobile apps using Swift and React Native in the past. This is my first time trying Flutter. For now, I am only releasing iOS app. If this goes well (hopefully), I might publish the Android version as well.</p><p>For cloud provider, I opted to go with AWS. It&rsquo;s really simple and cheap solution.</p><ul><li>Cognito for Users management</li><li>API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB for Backend</li><li>S3/Cloudfront for the marketing website</li></ul><h2 id=costs>Costs</h2><ul><li>$149 for Apple Developer membership</li><li>$15 for the domain itemeter.com</li><li>$0.82 per month, projected $10 per year</li></ul><p>A total grand of $174 AUD for one year. I think I can afford this.</p></div><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/hustle>hustle</a></li><li><a href=/tags/mobile>mobile</a></li><li><a href=/tags/app>app</a></li><li><a href=/tags/ios>ios</a></li><li><a href=/tags/flutter>flutter</a></li><li><a href=/tags/indie>indie</a></li></ul></nav></div><hr style=border-color:#f4f4f4><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=namnd/namnd.github.io data-repo-id=R_kgDOIuwbYQ data-category="Blog comments" data-category-id=DIC_kwDOIuwbYc4CTmoW data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=top data-theme=light data-lang=en data-loading=lazy crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>© Copyright namnd.com | <a href=https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil>Ezhil theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
