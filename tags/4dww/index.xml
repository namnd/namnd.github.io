InDebted, &lt;a href="https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/workplace/why-indebted-is-australia-s-best-place-to-work-20220407-p5aboy#:~:text=Introducing%20a%20four-day%20week,BOSS%20Best%20Place%20to%20Work">who won the best place to work in Australia in 2022&lt;/a> is one of the first companies in Australia that offers four days working week as well as fully remote work.
As I have been working 4DWW for almost a year now, I want to reflect on this experience, mostly for my personal development, and hopefully, it might also be useful to someone else.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
